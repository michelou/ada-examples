-- FILE    : buffers.ads
-- SUBJECT : Package providing various buffer manipulating subprograms.
--
-- A Buffer is essentially a string bounded in length to Maximum_Size. However, unlike the
-- Standard.String type, Buffer_Type has subprograms more in keeping with use as a storage
-- area for raw data.
